STL - Standard Template Library

STL can be divided into
    1 - Containers
        - pre-implemented data structures inside STL.
        - these containers can be further divided into: 
            1. Sequential Containers - elements stored in sequential order as initialized
                - Vectors, stacks, queue, array, deque, list, pair(not a container)
            2. Ordered (associative) containers - elements stored in sorted order either ascending or descending
                - Maps, Multimap, set, mutliset
            3. Unordered containers - elements stored are not sorted 
                - unordered map, unordered set
        - Nested Containers - containers inside containers
            - vector <vector<int>>
            - map <int, vector <int>>
            - set <pair<int, string>> 


    2 - Iterators
        - points to the memory location of containers
        - vector <int>::iterator it;


    3 - Algorithms
        - Optimized algorithms already implemented inside STL.
        - upper_bound(), lower_bound(), sort(), max(), min(), reverse(), count(), find()
    

    4 - Functors (not necessary for competitive programmimg)
        - Classes which can as as functions
